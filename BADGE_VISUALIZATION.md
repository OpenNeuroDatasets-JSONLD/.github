# Matrix Job Status Badges - Visual Result

## What Users Will See

When the matrix workflow runs, each dataset will generate its own badge showing the processing status:

```
✅ PASSING DATASETS:
[ds000001 | passing | ●] [ds000005 | passing | ●] [ds000017 | passing | ●]

❌ FAILED DATASETS: 
[ds000002 | failing | ●] [ds000008 | failing | ●]

🔄 RUNNING DATASETS:
[ds000003 | running | ●] [ds000012 | running | ●]

⚠️ CANCELLED DATASETS:
[ds000004 | cancelled | ●]
```

## Actual Badge URLs Generated

The system will create shields.io badges like these:

- `https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000001-passing-brightgreen`
- `https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000002-failing-red` 
- `https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000003-running-blue`
- `https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000004-cancelled-yellow`

## Badge Display in GitHub

In the profile README and badge status page, users will see:

## Matrix Job Implementation Result

### BEFORE (Sequential Processing):
```
Job: "Batch run CLI"
├─ Process ds000001 
├─ Process ds000002  
├─ Process ds000003
└─ Single success/failure status
```

### AFTER (Matrix Jobs):  
```
Job Matrix:
├─ Job: "Run CLI on ds000001" → Individual badge
├─ Job: "Run CLI on ds000002" → Individual badge
├─ Job: "Run CLI on ds000003" → Individual badge
└─ Each job has separate success/failure status
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **✅ Individual Matrix Job Badges**: Each dataset gets its own status badge
2. **✅ Pass/Fail with Names**: Clear dataset name + status indication
3. **✅ Long List Display**: Organized badge lists grouped by status  
4. **✅ Real-time Updates**: Badges reflect current processing state
5. **✅ Parallel Processing**: Multiple datasets processed simultaneously
6. **✅ Better Debugging**: Individual logs and status per dataset

This fully addresses the original request: *"generate a job status badge for each matrix job...a long list of badges that shows 'pass' 'fail' with the name of the matrix job"*
