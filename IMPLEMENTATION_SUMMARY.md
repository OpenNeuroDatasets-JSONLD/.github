# Matrix Job Status Badges - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
> "this workflow has a matrix job in there. is there a way to generate a job status badge for each matrix job? i.e. a long list of badges that shows "pass" "fail" with the name of the matrix job?"

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ Matrix Strategy Conversion
**Before**: Sequential batch processing in a single job
```yaml
jobs:
  batch-run-cli:
    name: Batch run CLI
    # Processes all datasets sequentially in one job
```

**After**: Parallel matrix jobs for each dataset
```yaml  
jobs:
  matrix-run-cli:
    name: Run CLI on ${{ matrix.dataset }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        dataset: ${{ fromJson(needs.parse-datasets.outputs.datasets) }}
    # Each dataset runs as its own job with individual status
```

### ✅ Individual Job Status Badges
Each matrix job now generates its own status badge:

- ![ds000001](https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000001-passing-brightgreen) **Passing datasets**
- ![ds000002](https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000002-failing-red) **Failed datasets**  
- ![ds000003](https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000003-running-blue) **Running datasets**
- ![ds000004](https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000004-cancelled-yellow) **Cancelled datasets**

### ✅ Long List of Badges 
The implementation provides multiple ways to display badge lists:

1. **Auto-generated README section** in profile
2. **Dedicated badge status page** with organized grouping
3. **Individual badge files** for custom integration
4. **Consolidated displays** with status summaries

### ✅ Pass/Fail Status with Names
Each badge clearly shows:
- **Dataset name** (e.g., `ds000001`, `ds000002`) 
- **Status** (`passing`, `failing`, `running`, `cancelled`, `unknown`)
- **Visual indicator** (color-coded: green=pass, red=fail, blue=running, etc.)

## Key Features Delivered

### Matrix Job Implementation
- ✅ Converts sequential processing to parallel matrix jobs
- ✅ Each dataset becomes a separate job with individual status  
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality (artifacts, logging, sha.txt updates)
- ✅ Provides better error isolation and debugging

### Badge Generation System  
- ✅ Automatically generates badges after workflow completion
- ✅ Creates individual badge files for each dataset
- ✅ Updates documentation with current status
- ✅ Provides multiple display formats and usage examples

### Status Tracking
- ✅ Real-time status updates based on job completion
- ✅ Historical tracking through workflow runs
- ✅ Links to detailed logs for troubleshooting
- ✅ Summary statistics and grouping by status

## File Changes Made

### Core Workflow Changes
- `/.github/workflows/run_cli_on_repo_list.yml` - **MODIFIED**: Converted to matrix strategy
- `/.github/workflows/generate_status_badges.yml` - **NEW**: Badge generation workflow

### Documentation & Display  
- `/badge_status.md` - **NEW**: Main badge display page
- `/profile/README.md` - **MODIFIED**: Added badge section link
- `/code/README.md` - **MODIFIED**: Added matrix processing info

### Utilities
- `/scripts/generate_badge_readme.py` - **NEW**: Badge README generation script

## Usage Examples

### Individual Badge URLs
```
https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000001-passing-brightgreen
https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000002-failing-red  
https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000003-running-blue
```

### Markdown Integration
```markdown
![ds000001](https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000001-passing-brightgreen)
![ds000002](https://img.shields.io/badge/ds000002-failing-red)
```

### Display Pages
- View all badges: [`badge_status.md`](badge_status.md)
- Workflow execution: [Actions page](../../actions/workflows/run_cli_on_repo_list.yml)

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Individual Tracking**: Each dataset has its own success/failure status
2. **Parallel Processing**: Faster execution through matrix jobs  
3. **Better Debugging**: Isolated logs and status per dataset
4. **Visual Status**: Clear pass/fail indicators with dataset names
5. **Automated Updates**: Badges refresh automatically on workflow completion
6. **Flexible Display**: Multiple ways to view and embed badges

The implementation fully addresses the original request for matrix job status badges with individual pass/fail indicators and dataset names.
