# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to augmented OpenNeuro datasets!

Repositories contained in this github organization are individual OpenNeuro BIDS datasets that have been augmented with additional, harmonized annotations of the phenotypic data
based on a [proposed extension of the BIDS `participants.json` schema](https://www.neurobagel.org/documentation/dictionaries/).

DataLad is a free and open source distributed data management system that keeps track of your data, creates structure, ensures reproducibility, supports collaboration, and integrates with widely used data infrastructure.
